\wfd{(NEED TO UPDATE THIS SECTION LEL)}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Hoang Kim Nguyen, both for suggesting me
this intriguing topic and for helping and guiding me in every step of the
creation of this thesis.

I would like to thanks my cosupervisor, Denis-Charles Cisinski, for making the
theory of $\infty$-categories accessible to me and others.

I would like to thank all the professors and the staff in Leiden and in
Regensburg universities and all the ALGANT consortium to make this experience
possible.

Thank you to all the friends I met in Leiden and Regensburg. A special thank you
goes to those who supported me during these last few difficult years, for
listening and encouraging me when I was feeling down.\\

Thank you to my parents, who have always been there, supporting me both
emotionally and economically, who have always encouraged me to pursue my
interests in any field.
